# Qi-Time-Calculator
The Qi-Time Chronoacupuncture Calculator is a web-based tool that calculates optimal acupuncture treatment times using Zi Wu Liu Zhu principles. It combines the user’s Five Element constitutional type with traditional organ-meridian peak hours, sexagenary cycle timing, lunar phases, solar chronobiology, and a 60-day cosmic energy cycle to produce a real-time “Qi strength” score and visual field display. The application presents favorable treatment windows, highlights current peak periods, and offers educational explanations of the underlying TCM and astronomical methods. Designed for fun, it supports informed treatment scheduling, documentation, and integration with traditional therapeutic practice.

Here is the thing though: The problem is that research does not provide the actual calculation formulas for traditional Zi Wu Liu Zhu. From my research thus far, it discusses its importance but doesn't provide the mathematical methods, so I came up with my own "modern" version in what will soon be ancient times. Again, the actual Zi Wu Liu Zhu calculation formulas are NOT in modern published research that I have access to, it doesn't mean it's not out there, somewhere....probably among the elites. 

This version only has: 
Moon calculations (lunar phases)
Solar chronobiology (morning/evening effects)
Four seasons integration (solar periods)


The Slopek & Feng Paper states:

"The fundament of time-related acupuncture is the Ten Heavenly Stems, and the Twelve Earthly Branches. For the calculation of the optimum time for acupuncture according to the method of Zi Wu Liu Zhu only the knowledge of the Ten Heavenly Stems and how to use them is necessary."


"The shortest cycle is a 24 h, the longest time cycle is a 60 d for the daily use of chronoacupuncture."

What This Means:

Zi Wu Liu Zhu = Heavenly Stems + 60-day cycle NOT organ meridian timing (that's a different system) 24-hour and 60-day cycles are the foundation. So, now I'm going to build some Modern + Traditional in a different repositary.
