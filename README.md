# Qi-Time-Calculator
Displays electromagnetic qi field visualizations and Calculates timing based on the chronoacupuncture principles. This is being built out. I understand that this calclator must include Solar data (sunrise/sunset, solar position); Seasonal qi adjustments based on the primary constitution; Star positions (traditional Chinese astronomical calculations); The 60-day chronoacupuncture cycle mentioned in the paper; and perhaps other info I'm not thinking about right now.
