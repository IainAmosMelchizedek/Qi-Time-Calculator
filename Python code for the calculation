sexagenary day position of August 12, 2025:

calculate the sexagenary day position of August 12, 2025, relative to the Datong Li epoch starting on October 20, 1383, which is a Jia-Zi day (Day #1 of the 60-day cycle).

Step 1: Understand the inputs
A. Epoch date (Day #1, Jia-Zi): October 20, 1383 (Gregorian calendar)
B. Target date: August 12, 2025
C. Cycle length: 60 days

Step 2: Calculate the total number of days between the two dates. Need to find:
Days difference = Days from Oct 20, 1383 to Aug 12, 2025

Step 3: Calculate the sexagenary day position 
Position=((Days difference)mod60)+1

We add 1 because October 20, 1383, is Day #1.

Step 4: Perform the calculation
Python code for the calculation:
from datetime import date

# Define the epoch date (Datong Li Jia-Zi day)
epoch_date = date(1383, 10, 20)

# Define the target date
target_date = date(2025, 8, 12)

# Calculate the difference in days
days_diff = (target_date - epoch_date).days

# Calculate the sexagenary day position
position = (days_diff % 60) + 1

print(f"Days difference: {days_diff}")
print(f"Sexagenary day position: {position} out of 60")

Here are the results:

Days difference between October 20, 1383 and August 12, 2025: 234,417 days

Sexagenary day position = (234,417 mod 60) + 1 = 58
